        Q:"Q: What is a 403(b) savings account?",
        A:"A: Aso known as a tax sheltered annuity(TSA), a 403b is an automatic savings plan that you can set up through your payroll department and allows you to save for retirement before state or federal taxes (tax deferred).

        Q:"Q: What is the penalty for early withdrawls (before age 59 1/2)",
        A:'A: There is a 10% penalty for early withdrawal of qualified retirement funds prior to age 59 1/2 and all withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. That is unless the distributions are rolled-over to another qualified retirement plan. Other exceptions include: if the annuitant is totally disabled, separates from service (after age 55), or dies. Also, the salary reduction amounts (but not the earnings) are available for "financial hardship" use e.g., an immediate and heavy financial need which cannot be met with other assets.'
